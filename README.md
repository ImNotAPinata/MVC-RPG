# MVC-RPG
A simple app to create a basic RPG game in javascript with MVC.ASPNET and the ImpactJS engine. Feel free to contribute. 

As impact is a pay library i did not add it to the current branch. In order to make use please copy Lib and media Folders
into the main project root.

You will need to have php in your computer thought but its simple to have it install in your webserver.
